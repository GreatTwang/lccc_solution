//profit(diff of buy&sell prices) of the two transactions,each time we meet a new i,
//we try to update the max of these 4 sum

//order of updating these 4 variables also matters: 
//sell2 based on hold2; hold2 based on sell1; sell1 based on hold1;
//updating sell1 before hold1 is to create a 1-day time difference between 1st sell and 1st buy, 
//instead of on the same day
//updating sell2 before hold2 is to create a 1-day time difference between 2st sell and 2st buy, 
//instead of on the same day
//updating sell2&hold2 before sell1&hold1 is to create a 1-day time difference between them, 
//instead of on the same day\

//sell2: max val of (-firstBuyPrice + firstSellPrice -secondBuyPrice + secondSellPrice)
// if we've just sold 2nd stock so far
//hold2: max val of (-firstBuyPrice + firstSellPrice -secondBuyPrice) 
//if we've just buy  2nd stock so far
//sell1: max val of (-firstBuyPrice + firstSellPrice) if we've just sold 1nd stock so far
//hold1: max val of (-firstBuyPrice) if we've just buy  1st stock so far
