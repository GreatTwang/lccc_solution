use Math.max(left[j], currLeftBound) cuz we need to use the rightmost left boundary when we expanding to left from j col
use Math.min(right[j], currRightBound) cuz we need to use the leftmost right boundary when we expanding to right from j col
1. left(i,j) = max(left(i-1,j), cur_left), cur_left can be determined from the current row
2. right(i,j) = min(right(i-1,j), cur_right), cur_right can be determined from the current row
3. height(i,j) = height(i-1,j) + 1, if matrix[i][j]=='1';
4. height(i,j) = 0, if matrix[i][j]=='0'
eg.
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
The vector "left" and "right" from row 0 to row 2 are as follows:

row 0:
l: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
r: 7 7 7 4 7 7 7

row 1:
l: 0 0 2 3 2 0 0
r: 7 7 5 4 5 7 7 

row 2:
l: 0 1 2 3 2 1 0
r: 7 6 5 4 5 6 7
The vector "left" is computing the left boundary.Take (i,j)=(1,3) for example, on current row 1, left boundary is at j=2.
However, cuz matrix[1][3] is 1,we need to consider the left boundary on previous row too, which is 3, not currLeftBound2.
So the real left boundary at (1,3) is 3.
